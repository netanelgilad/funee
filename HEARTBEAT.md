# Funee Heartbeat

On each heartbeat:
1. Read TASKS.md for current state
2. Pick the first "In Progress" task, or move top "Queued" to "In Progress"
3. Work on the task (write tests first, then implement)
4. Run tests to verify
5. Commit and push if task is complete
6. Update #funee with progress
7. Update TASKS.md

Keep commits atomic - one feature per commit.
